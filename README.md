# Detecting-high-dimensional-time-bin-entanglement-in-fiber-loop-systems

This repository contains the data from numerical simulations presented in the paper "Detecting high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop systems" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18336) as well as all scripts used to generate and visiualize it. The source code used in the scripts is stored seperately in the Julia package "TimeBinEncoding.jl" (https://github.com/NiklasEuler/TimeBinEncoding.jl).
